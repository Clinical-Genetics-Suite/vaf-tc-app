An interactive visual tool for differentiating germline and somatic variants in **tumor-only sequencing**, based on the mathematical relationship between pathological **Tumor Content (TC)** and **Variant Allele Fraction (VAF)**.

> **Disclaimer:** This tool is intended as a supportive aid for genetic counseling. It does not replace confirmatory germline testing or established clinical guidelines (ACMG, AMED Kosugi group). Further prospective validation is required.

## Live Application

**https://vaf-tc-app.streamlit.app/**

## Background

In tumor-only comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), distinguishing germline from somatic variants is a fundamental challenge. While VAF of approximately 50% is often assumed to indicate a germline heterozygous variant, **somatic variants with LOH can produce the same VAF** depending on tumor content — a diagnostic trap.

This tool visualizes five theoretical VAF-TC models derived from **Knudson's two-hit hypothesis** (diploid model) and provides automated clinical alerts for known ambiguity zones.

## Mathematical Models

Given tumor content *f* (0-1):

| Model | Formula | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Germline + cnLOH | VAF = (1 + f) / 2 | Germline variant with copy-neutral LOH (UPD) |
| Germline + LOH (Del) | VAF = 1 / (2 - f) | Germline variant with LOH by deletion |
| Germline Heterozygous | VAF = 0.5 | Germline variant without LOH |
| Somatic + cnLOH | VAF = f | Somatic variant with copy-neutral LOH (UPD) |
| Somatic + LOH (Del) | VAF = f / (2 - f) | Somatic variant with LOH by deletion |

A **+/-10% error margin** is applied for model matching to account for variability in pathological TC estimation.

## Clinical Alert System

The app generates four context-dependent alerts based on TC and VAF:

### Alert 1 - Somatic cnLOH Trap (TC 40-60%)

At TC near 50%, Somatic + cnLOH produces VAF = TC, which falls within +/-10% of Germline Heterozygous (50%). A somatic variant with acquired uniparental disomy (UPD) can masquerade as a germline finding. Pair-normal testing is essential.

### Alert 2 - Gray Zone (TC 61-66%)

As TC increases toward 66.7%, Somatic + LOH (Del) = f/(2-f) approaches 50% from below. In this range, the somatic LOH deletion line is close enough to 50% to create ambiguity with Germline Heterozygous variants.

### Alert 3 - LOH Convergence Zone (TC >= 67%)

At TC = 2/3 (approximately 66.7%), Somatic + LOH (Del) **exactly equals** Germline Heterozygous at 50%. Above this TC, the somatic and germline LOH lines converge. This alert fires when:

- **TC >= 67%**, AND
- **VAF >= Somatic LOH (Del) line** at current TC

Both conditions must be met. The alert displays the actual theoretical values for clinical reference.

### Alert 4 - Extreme Tumor Purity (TC >= 90%)

At very high purity, all five theoretical models compress into a narrow VAF range. Variants may still be of somatic origin even at high VAF. This alert fires regardless of VAF, as germline testing becomes essential in all cases.
